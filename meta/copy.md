Soundspeed saves recordings in your Dropbox. It can playback any sound file in your Dropbox at normal, half, one and a half, or double speed.

This application requires a Dropbox account to store your files. See https://www.dropbox.com/register for a free account and 2GB of storage.

If you don't have an internet connection, or uploading is interrupted, Soundspeed will save your files and automatically upload them when you have an internet connection.

This app is great for students who want to lectures and listen to them later. You can also move any sound file into the Soundspeed folder in your Dropbox and use the speed features to listen to them.
